# ðŸ“š Pixflux Batch Generator Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the PixelLab AI Batch Generator! This tool is designed to give pixel artists unprecedented control over batch generation with complete transparency.

## ðŸŽ¨ What is This?

A powerful web application that:
- Generates pixel art through the PixelLab AI API
- Creates hundreds of unique variations from dynamic prompts
- Shows exactly which variations were selected
- Manages wildcards as files for permanence
- Provides complete metadata transparency

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

1. **Wildcards**: Reusable collections of options stored as `.txt` files
2. **Dynamic Prompts**: Templates that generate variations
3. **Selection Transparency**: See exactly what was chosen for each image
4. **File-Based Storage**: Wildcards persist across sessions and ports
5. **Metadata Embedding**: All generation data saved in PNG files

## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

This tool is built on the principle of **creative transparency**. Every feature is designed to:
- Show you exactly what happened
- Let you reproduce successes
- Help you understand what works
- Give you complete control
