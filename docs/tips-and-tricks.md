## Prompt Engineering

### Start Simple, Add Complexity

```
Level 1: "a dragon"
Level 2: "a red dragon breathing fire"
Level 3: "a {red|blue|green} dragon {breathing fire|sleeping|flying}"
Level 4: "a {young|ancient} __colors__ dragon __actions__, __styles__, __quality__"
```

### The Power of Commas

Structure matters for AI interpretation:
```
Good: "dragon, breathing fire, in a cave, dramatic lighting"
Less effective: "dragon breathing fire in a cave with dramatic lighting"
```

### Negative Prompts Are Your Friend

Common negative descriptors:
```
blurry, ugly, distorted, disfigured, low quality, bad anatomy, 
wrong colors, extra limbs, missing parts, text, watermark
```

### Style Stacking

Layer compatible styles:
```
"pixel art, 16-bit style, __artists__, retro game aesthetic"
```

But avoid conflicts:
```
Bad: "photorealistic, abstract, pixel art"  // Conflicting styles
```

## Wildcard Mastery

### Create Themed Collections

**RPG Items Wildcard:**
```
legendary flaming sword
common wooden shield  
rare healing potion
epic dragon scale armor
cursed necromancer staff
blessed paladin hammer
```

**Emotions Wildcard:**
```
joyfully laughing
sadly crying
angrily shouting
fearfully trembling
proudly standing
shyly blushing
```

### Weighted Wildcards

Repeat options for higher probability:
```
common
common
common
uncommon
uncommon
rare
legendary
```

### Contextual Wildcards

Create wildcards that work together:
```
__weather__: "rainy", "sunny", "stormy"
__weather_actions__: "holding umbrella", "wearing sunglasses", "seeking shelter"
```

### Testing Wildcards

1. Disable all other wildcards
2. Generate 10-20 images
3. Review which options work well
4. Remove unsuccessful options
5. Add more variations of successful ones

## Batch Optimization

### Finding Your Sweet Spot

| Images | Delay | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 5-10   | 1-2s  | Testing prompts |
| 20-50  | 2-3s  | Exploring variations |
| 50-100 | 3-5s  | Production runs |

### Memory Management

```
Every 50 images:
1. Download current batch
2. Clear gallery
3. Continue generating
```

### Seed Sequences

For related images:
```
Base seed: 12345
Character poses: 12345, 12346, 12347
Environment variations: 12345, 12355, 12365
```

### Queue Strategies

**Progressive Refinement:**
1. Generate 10 with broad wildcards
2. Review and identify best combinations
3. Create specific wildcards from winners
4. Generate 50 with refined wildcards

## Creative Techniques

### The Variation Matrix

Create systematic variations:
```
Characters: {male|female} {elf|dwarf|human}
Classes: {warrior|mage|rogue}
Moods: {happy|angry|determined}
Total combinations: 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 54 unique characters
```

### Style Evolution

Track your style preferences:
```
1. Generate same subject with all style wildcards
2. Download favorites
3. Extract metadata to see which styles worked
4. Create custom style wildcard with winners
```

### Color Harmony

Create color-coordinated sets:
```
__warm_palette__:
warm orange tones
sunset colors
golden yellow hues
deep red shades

__cool_palette__:
ocean blue tones
mint green colors
purple twilight hues
icy cyan shades
```

### Prompt Templates

Save successful formulas:
```
Portrait: "close-up portrait of __character__, __expression__, __lighting__, __styles__"
Item: "game icon of __rarity__ __item_type__, __colors__, clean background"
Scene: "__time_of_day__ in __location__, __weather__, __mood__ atmosphere"
```

## Workflow Automation

### Wildcard Backup Strategy

```bash
# Backup wildcards
cd backend/wildcards
tar -czf wildcards-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz *.txt

# Restore wildcards
tar -xzf wildcards-backup-20240115.tar.gz
```

### Batch Processing Pipeline

1. **Morning**: Generate 100 character sprites
2. **Afternoon**: Review and select best 20
3. **Evening**: Generate variations of winners
4. **Next Day**: Create new wildcards from patterns

### Metadata Mining

Extract patterns from successful images:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for analysis
const successes = images.filter(img => img.rating === 5);
const commonSelections = findCommonPatterns(successes);
const newWildcard = createWildcardFromPatterns(commonSelections);
```

### Project Organization

```
project-fantasy-game/
├── wildcards/
│   ├── characters.txt
│   ├── items.txt
│   └── environments.txt
├── generated/
│   ├── batch-001/
│   ├── batch-002/
│   └── favorites/
└── templates.txt
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Conditional Prompting

Use variations to create conditional logic:
```
{a brave|a cowardly} knight {charging forward|hiding behind shield}
```

### Narrative Sequences

Generate story sequences with consistent seed:
```
Seed 1000: "hero at tavern, __moods__"
Seed 1001: "hero meeting quest giver, __moods__"  
Seed 1002: "hero battling dragon, __moods__"
```

### Style Mixing

Combine unexpected elements:
```
"__traditional_art__ style but with __modern_elements__"
```

### Aspect Variations

Same subject, different aspects:
```
Base: "ancient temple"
Variations:
- "ancient temple exterior, __weather__"
- "ancient temple interior, __lighting__"
- "ancient temple ruins, __time_of_day__"
```

## Troubleshooting Pro Tips

### When Results Don't Match Expectations

1. **Check Selection Display**: See what was actually chosen
2. **Test Wildcards Individually**: Isolate problem wildcards
3. **Simplify Prompt**: Remove elements until it works
4. **Check Negative Prompt**: May be too restrictive

### Debugging Wildcards

```
Test prompt: "a simple __wildcard__ test"
Expected: Clear visibility of wildcard effect
```

### Rate Limit Recovery

```
If hit rate limit:
1. Stop queue immediately
2. Wait 60 seconds
3. Increase delay by 2 seconds
4. Resume with smaller batch
```

### Quality Consistency

For consistent quality across batch:
- Use same seed + increments
- Keep prompt complexity similar
- Don't mix incompatible styles
- Use consistent quality wildcards

## Performance Tips

### Browser Optimization

- Use Chrome/Edge for best performance
- Close other tabs when generating large batches
- Clear gallery every 50-100 images
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere

### Server Optimization

```javascript
// Increase Node.js memory if needed
node --max-old-space-size=4096 server.js
```

### Network Optimization

- Use wired connection for large batches
- Avoid peak hours (varies by region)
- Monitor for timeout errors
- Increase delay if seeing connection issues

## Creative Challenges

### 30-Day Challenge Ideas

1. **Day 1-5**: Master basic wildcards
2. **Day 6-10**: Create 5 custom wildcards
3. **Day 11-15**: Generate 500 images, analyze patterns
4. **Day 16-20**: Build themed collections
5. **Day 21-25**: Experiment with style mixing
6. **Day 26-30**: Create complete asset set

### The Perfect Prompt Challenge

Goal: Create a prompt that generates 90%+ keepers
- Start with 10 image tests
- Refine after each batch
- Document what improves success rate
- Share your formula!

### Wildcard Roulette

1. Create 10 random wildcards
2. Activate all
3. Empty prompt (wildcards only)
4. Generate 20 images
5. Find surprising combinations

## Community Sharing

### Sharing Wildcards

```bash
# Export your wildcards
cd backend/wildcards
zip my-wildcards.zip *.txt

# Share with attribution
# "Fantasy Creatures Pack by YourName"
```

### Prompt Attribution

When sharing prompts:
```
Prompt: "..."
Wildcards used: [artists, styles, moods]
Success rate: 8/10
Notes: Works best with 64x64
```
