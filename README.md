## The Ultimate Pixel Art Generation Tool with Dynamic Prompts & Complete Transparency

### üåü What Is This?

This is a powerful web application that connects to PixelLab AI's API to generate pixel art. But it's not just any generator - it's designed to create **hundreds of unique variations** from a single prompt, with complete transparency about what variations were selected, intelligent queue management, and dynamic prompt generation.

Think of it as your pixel art factory with X-ray vision - you design the blueprint, it creates endless variations, and shows you exactly how each one was made.

## üé≤ The Wildcard System

### What Are Wildcards?

Wildcards are **collections of options** that can be randomly selected when generating images. Think of them as dice with many sides - each time you roll, you get a different result.

### üÜï Click-to-Add Feature

The wildcard manager now supports **click-to-append** functionality:
- Click any wildcard name (like `__styles__`) to add it to your prompt
- It automatically adds proper comma separation
- The checkbox still controls whether the wildcard is active
- See instant feedback when wildcards are added

### How Wildcards Work

When you write `__artists__` in your prompt, the system:
1. Looks for a wildcard named "artists"
2. Randomly picks one option from that wildcard
3. Replaces `__artists__` with the selected option
4. **Shows you exactly what was selected in the image viewer**

### Pre-Installed Wildcards

The app comes with 6 example wildcards:

#### üé® `__artists__` (20 options)
```
by Zdislaw Beksinski
by Vincent Van Gogh
by Michelangelo
by Leonardo da Vinci
by Pablo Picasso
...and 15 more
```

#### üñåÔ∏è `__styles__` (20 options)
```
anime style
surrealist style
expressionist style
impressionist style
cubist style
...and 15 more
```

#### üòä `__moods__` (20 options)
```
cheerful
melancholic
mysterious
energetic
peaceful
...and 15 more
```

#### üí° `__lighting__` (20 options)
```
soft lighting
dramatic lighting
rim lighting
backlit
golden hour
...and 15 more
```

#### üé® `__colors__` (20 options)
```
vibrant colors
muted colors
pastel colors
neon colors
monochrome
...and 15 more
```

#### ‚≠ê `__quality__` (20 options)
```
masterpiece
high quality
ultra detailed
professional
award winning
...and 15 more
```

### Creating Your Own Wildcards

1. Click "Wildcard Manager" to expand the section
2. Click "New Wildcard"
3. Give it a name (use lowercase and underscores)
4. Add options, one per line
5. Click "Save Wildcard"

#### Example: Creating a Fantasy Creatures Wildcard

Name: `fantasy_creatures`

Content:
```
dragon breathing fire
unicorn with rainbow mane
phoenix rising from ashes
griffin with golden feathers
pegasus flying through clouds
basilisk with deadly gaze
hydra with seven heads
chimera prowling
mermaid on a rock
centaur archer
```

Now you can:
- Use `__fantasy_creatures__` in any prompt
- Click the wildcard name to append it instantly
- See which creature was selected in the image viewer

### Managing Wildcards

- **Enable/Disable**: Click the checkbox to activate/deactivate
- **Click to Add**: Click the wildcard name to append to prompt
- **Edit**: Click the pencil icon to modify
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove
- **Bulk Actions**: "Enable All" or "Disable All"
- **Visual Status**: Active wildcards show a purple "ACTIVE" badge

## üéØ Dynamic Prompting

<img width="879" height="358" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1139dc4-7740-4997-8188-8d16cfb0f139" />

### Syntax Options

#### 1. Inline Variations: `{option1|option2|option3}`

Example:
```
A {cute|fierce|mystical} dragon in a {forest|castle|cave}
```

Possible outputs:
- "A cute dragon in a forest"
- "A fierce dragon in a castle"  
- "A mystical dragon in a cave"
- (and 6 other combinations!)

#### 2. Wildcards: `__wildcard_name__`

Example:
```
A dragon painted __styles__, __artists__, with __lighting__
```

Possible output:
- "A dragon painted anime style, by Vincent Van Gogh, with golden hour"

#### 3. Combining Both

Example:
```
A {baby|adult|ancient} __fantasy_creatures__ in {pixel art|16-bit|8-bit} __styles__, __moods__ atmosphere, __quality__
```

This can generate thousands of unique combinations!

### üÜï Selection Transparency

After generation, the image viewer shows:
- **Original prompt**: What you typed
- **Final prompt**: What was actually sent to the API
- **Dynamic selections**: A breakdown showing:
  - üé≤ Wildcard selections (e.g., `__styles__` ‚Üí `anime style`)
  - üîÄ Variation selections (e.g., `{cute|scary}` ‚Üí `cute`)

This complete transparency helps you:
- Understand what worked well
- Recreate successful combinations
- Debug unexpected results
- Learn which wildcards produce the best results

## üì¶ Batch Generation

<img width="915" height="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1de999f-52bc-4318-bfe0-9ec41cd1860f" />

### Understanding the Queue System

The batch system lets you generate multiple images without hitting rate limits:

1. **Set Batch Count**: Use the slider (1-100 images)
2. **Set Delay**: Time between each generation (1-10 seconds)
3. **Click Add to Queue**: Adds variations to the queue
4. **Start Queue**: Begins processing

### üÜï Enhanced Visual Feedback

Queue items now show clear status indicators:
- **Pending**: Normal appearance, waiting to process
- **Processing**: Purple ring with pulse animation
- **Completed**: Green checkmark, slightly faded
- **Failed**: Red alert icon, more faded

The improved animations make it easy to track progress at a glance!

### How It Works

1. Each image in the batch gets a unique variation (if using dynamic prompts)
2. Images are generated one at a time with your specified delay
3. **Every selection is tracked and displayed** in the image viewer
4. You can pause/resume anytime
5. Failed images show error messages
6. All images are saved to the gallery with full metadata

### Rate Limit Strategy

PixelLab has rate limits based on your subscription tier. The delay system helps you stay within limits:

- **Free Tier**: Use 3-5 second delays
- **Paid Tiers**: Can use 1-2 second delays
- **Large Batches**: Consider longer delays to be safe
